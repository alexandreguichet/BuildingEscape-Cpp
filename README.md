# BuildingEscape-Cplusplus
A small puzzle game with C++ and Unreal Engine. This project was meant to learn about Unreal editor and it's c++ library.

This project was made following Udemy's course from Ben Tristem

The puzzle is to escape a room by placing objects into a certain area to open a door.

An improvement of the game would be to implement a UI telling the player what to do, how to do it. 
Create an end screen and more complex puzzles.
